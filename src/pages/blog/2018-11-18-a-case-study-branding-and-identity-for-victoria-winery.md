## Challenge

The brand needs to embody the environmental consciousness efforts made by the owners to produce high class organic wines. In the process of creative direction, we need to promote the feeling to confidence in the vision, value and culture in which lies the main competitive advantage of the brand’s positioning.

## Branding Goals and Creative Patterns

## Inspiration

We had a great time talking with the business owners as they were very enthusiastic with wines. They are also kind enough to send us some bottle of wines! During the consultation we asked some brands that they really liked the presentations. We examined and consider the functional criteria in these brands and align them together with the brand goal.

The best brands speak one distinctive voice which revolves mainly from the brand’s goal and works towards the customer. The strategy for the logo is to create a monolithic brand architecture that can keep the benefits of endorsement as the main product is geared towards their specific target audience.
