Let me share you an observation that happens on a daily basis.

When walking into a grocery store, a lot of people don’t give much thought as to which 5 lb bag of sugar to grab.

Sugar is sugar, right?

**Here is the reality**

You don’t want this to happen to the brand you’re trying to build. Or have built. You’ll need something that will make your business relevant in today’s noisy and crowded market.

Besides the general stuff like a facebook ad, nice store and things like that, let’s talk about something else.

Most of the businesses that we have served have probably been trained a certain way to write an ad copy. It’s pretty much a standard for in every course out there we’ve seen.

Here are some examples:

* “Selling quickly, get yours now!!!!”
* “5,000 or 10,000 SOLD!!!!”
* “Don’t Miss out!!”

Although this may be effective for some, it doesn’t really have a differentiating factor. If you notice based on the examples that I cited, most of them are about scarcity and product-centric. **I believe that a big way to differentiate the brand when writing an ad copy (and product page copy) is by making the customer the HERO.**

A lot of brands try to play the hero by telling potential customers repeatedly how much they’ve sold, or how long they’ve been in business, etc.

Branding is essential, but don’t overkill on brand-centered info when you’re trying to get them as a buyer. Put yourself in the customers shoes. Have a message that resonates on **WHY** your product is best for them.

A lot of customers won’t click that “buy now” button because a resolution to their need(s) or want has not been brought to light. Sometimes the problem isn’t your product, but the way you **TALK** about it.

Think about ways you can educate people more and conquer objections. Aside from retargeting or email marketing, one way is to engage with them. Ask them their opinion about your product, this gives them the sense of having authority/ownership to your product and will make them trust your brand more.

Again — this is definitely a different dynamic from your simple retargeting ads or product page copy many of you might be used to. More psychology behind it. More consumers are aware of the online sales process. A lot of them will not listen unless you craft your message the right way. And once you do that, you essentially have them hooked.

Copy is just one way to develop a unique selling proposition in a crowded marketplace.

In the coming articles, me and my team will share some case studies about the tricks companies use to manipulate consumer’s minds and persuade them from buying.

**Your Turn:**

Are you also focusing your brand story to make your audience as the HERO? If yes, what are your struggles and what strategies have worked for you?
