In case you haven’t been paying attention to digital marketing these past few years, you may have missed out on one of the most sparkling and talked-about concept: **branding**. The awareness it breeds of your company is priceless. Even MasterCard would agree. If you’re a marketer, you’ll want that awareness regardless of what any publication says.

**Brand name awareness equals credibility.**

Awareness of your brand or your business usually means confidence in it, and confidence is key to healthy sales.

Many people have purchased products or services simply because they were familiar with the name. They might have known zilch about the benefits or the price, but they bought anyhow. Simply being aware of the name was enough.

Researchers asking, “Why did you buy this product or service?” were frequently get this answer: “Because I heard of it.”

**_“Because I heard of it”_** is synonymous with Brand name awareness.

## **So how does a company achieve brand name awareness?**

Simple. By constant repetition of its name. This repetition can come from frequent marketing, continual exposure to a sign, repeated stories in the media, or a combination of all these.

The repetition penetrates the unconscious minds of the prospects. That’s where most purchase decisions are made. No wonder so many people buy things **“because they heard of them.”**

In our present marketplace, most small businesses are simply running ads optimised for sales conversion. While having a sale is great, every business should also invest on making their target audience confident in their brand because this increases lifetime customer value and referrals.
