After successfully working with many clients and helping them with the creation of their ideas, we’ve identified the three most important things that clients assessed before starting a project. There is no one designer that is fits for any and all projects, but there is a right designer for you. And to increase the odds of working with the right professionals, here are the three things that you want to check:

## 1. Quality of work

Checking their portfolio and see how well they’ve done their previous projects is a big help in deciding whether a designer can do the job for you. Beautiful and effective designs are your first priority. And by beautiful it means that their designs pleases and you should be able to recognize the amount of quality work they put into each and every design project. Effective means that they are the professionals that specialize in your niche. They are know the standard and best practices for every design that you need which can give an edge to your projects, whether its a branding, apparel or web design.

## 2. Quality of communications

You may have thought that the quality of work is the most important thing to consider when hiring a designer, but communications also play a pivotal role in having a successful design projects. Assess the way he or she handles the communication, check if you are comfortable talking to him or her and if they pay attention to the details of your chat or call. Keep in mind that during the project, you will be communicating regularly. Poor communication can turn off the project and end client relationships no matter how good of a designer they are.

## 3. Quality of execution

Know the execution behind some of their projects. Going through their testimonials and knowing what others are saying about them can give you a picture on how well they did their previous projects. Previous clients whom they worked with will probably mention how happy they are working with the designer. Their recognition will give you specifics on the designer’s personality, whether they are responsive, patient and understanding. Of course, if you are coming from a referral, they wouldn’t be recommending them if they don’t have a good reputation.
